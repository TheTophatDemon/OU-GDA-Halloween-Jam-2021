# Lost Dog - Entry for GDA Halloween Jam 2021
Vector art by Jerrod, everything else by Xander.

The "Spook Game" folder contains the unity project for the game.
This is, for the most part, the final state of the game submitted to the jam, but with some small improvements to the HUD and attempted bug fixes. This game
may be improved upon at some later date, but also may not.
